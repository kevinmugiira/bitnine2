## About Bitnine2

This is a design of a webpage similar to the Bitnine's official website. It has a login and signup page that enables a user to 
register for an account which then allows them to access the webpage.
It has been created using Laravel 10. To run the project, ensure you have php 8.1 and above installed, then install laravel. You can use this tutorial for installation:
- [Laravel 10.x installation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation)

Once done ensure that you have a server such as an apache server running. You can download the specific release according to your operating system.

After all these are set, crank up a terminal session and cd to the projects parent folder. Create a mysql database and update the .env file as per your databases credentials. Once done run these commands:
- 'php artisan migrate' (to set up your db into the application)
- 'php artisan serve' (to run the application)

Once running go to your browser/client and search: 'localhost:8000'. Next, register a new user and log in.

Enjoy!!
